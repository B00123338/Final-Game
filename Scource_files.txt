All the code I used for my game came from the create with code units 1-6 that we covered.

Create with code Assets: Unit 5 - Lab 5 (Course Library-Asset Store)

Unity Asset Store
Free Heavy Fighter Aircraft

I had problems with swapping over my assets, so I decided to leave them instead of breaking my code.
